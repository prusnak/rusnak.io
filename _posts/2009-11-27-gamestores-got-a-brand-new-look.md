title: GameStore's got a brand new look
---

Today I applied the new [Robert Lihm](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Rlihm)'s theme called [Bento](http://gitorious.org/opensuse/webdesign/trees/master/design_concept/theme_o.o-bento) to GameStore web, so it doesn't look like a quick hack anymore. This theme, which will be used across all [openSUSE.org](http://opensuse.org/) websites in the future, will also help to integrate [GameStore](http://en.opensuse.org/GameStore) into rest of the openSUSE infrastructure. You can visit the site here: gamestore.gk2.sk.
