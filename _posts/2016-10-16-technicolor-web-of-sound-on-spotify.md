title: Technicolor Web of Sound on Spotify
---

My friend is a big fan of psychedelic music from the 60s and 70s. Recently, he told me about the (now defunct) internet radio he really enjoyed listening to: [Technicolor Web of Sound](http://www.techwebsound.com/). He also mentioned that the website has a list of all artists and their songs that used to be in the rotation. I immediately got an idea to scrape the list and convert it to Spotify playlist.

And here's the result:

* [CSV file](/assets/technicolor.csv) with artists and tracks for further processing
* [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/stickac/playlist/55kIWwufZIwvCshXZhdRCR)

Enjoy!

PS: The playlist does not contain all songs, only the ones that are available on Spotify. Also it might contain bogus entries, because it is autogenerated. Please, send me an email in case something is wrong. Thanks!
