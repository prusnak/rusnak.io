title: "GNOME-Shell Extension: YaST (item in) Status Menu"
---

This is just a short follow-up to my older blogpost [Adding YaST menuitem to GNOME 3 status menu](/adding-yast-menuitem-to-gnome-3-status-menu/). Few minutes ago [Andy](http://www.wafaa.eu/) asked me if I could create a proper gnome-shell extension so I went ahead and did it. :-)

I've set a [git repo on Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/opensuse/gnome-shell-extension-yast-status-menu) and also built the package in my [home:prusnak](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=gnome-shell-extension-yast-status-menu&project=home%3Aprusnak) project. If there will be interest from our GNOME Team, I will create a submit request to some GNOME devel project and Factory as well.

If you don't know this yet, you have to install the `gnome-shell-extension-yast-status-menu` and then either logout and login or press Alt+F2 and type "r" (which will restart gnome-shell).

Enjoy! :-)
