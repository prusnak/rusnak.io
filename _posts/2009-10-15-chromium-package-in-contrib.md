title: Chromium package in Contrib
---

{% img /content/chromium.png %}

Thanks to unceasing endeavors of David Buck and [Raymond Wooninck](http://rwooninck.blogspot.com/) we now have [Chromium](http://code.google.com/chromium/) built fully from the source code! It is available from our [Contrib](http://en.opensuse.org/Contrib) repository (package `chromium`). I recommend using this one instead of various other RPMs that repack Google Chrome/Chromium binaries or are kept in users home repositories. Big thanks also goes to [Tom 'spot' Callaway](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Spot) for much of the original patchwork, [Justin Haygood](http://blog.justinhaygood.com/) for helping with the icu patch and Malcolm Lewis.
