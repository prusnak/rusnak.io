title: xkcd 715

I was playing with the idea to write an application inspired by [xkcd comics 715](http://xkcd.com/715/) since it was released, but today I finally found time to whip it up!

The whole source code is a single webpage (HTML+Javascript/jQuery) around 100 lines long. It basically forms the query by replacing hash sign "#" with the particular number from loop and then asks Google via its [Search API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/). Resulting data are shown via [Google Visualization API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/interactive_charts.html). It doesn't have much eye-candy yet, but it works and that's what counts. :-) I put the presets Randall came up with and also added some of my own. I will now describe the first three in detail:

The first one was `"xkcd #"`, which easily showed that the most popular issues were: [10](http://xkcd.com/10/), [12](http://xkcd.com/12/), [244](http://xkcd.com/244/), [385](http://xkcd.com/385/), [427](http://xkcd.com/427/), [449](http://xkcd.com/449/), [452](http://xkcd.com/452/), [505](http://xkcd.com/505/), [701](http://xkcd.com/701/), [705](http://xkcd.com/705/) and [714](http://xkcd.com/714/).

I continued with `"# czechoslovakia"`, which of course spotted the most important years of the 20th century for this country ([1918](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czechoslovakia_(1918–1938)), [1938](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia), [1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czechoslovakia_(1945–1948)), [1948](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czechoslovakia_(1948–1989)), [1968](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring#Invasion), [1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution) and [1993](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia)).

The last one, `"favorite number is #"`, shows the distribution of favorite numbers. Three, seven, eight and thirteen were expected, but I was surprised to see peak also at 42. I guess you know [why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29). :-)

Bear in mind that there are still some outstanding issues and also if you have any ideas for interesting presets to add, I'd be more than happy to include them!
