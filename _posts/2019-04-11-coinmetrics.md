After reading the great article by [@jpthor__](https://twitter.com/jpthor__) called [Bitcoinâ€™s True Market Dominance](https://medium.com/@jpthor/bitcoins-market-dominance-a9693ff604bf) I realised I need to create a tool where I can follow relevance of various coins.

Relevance is computed by multiplying marketcap and trading volume of the coin.

**No surprises here, Bitcoin is the most relevant coin.**

Second is Ethereum, which is 8-times less relevant (12%). Third is Tether with 2.5% (40-times less relevant). There are two more coins (XRP and EOS) with relevancy more than 1% (100-times less relevant). Other coins are not even worth mentioning.

Table contains also another parameter which I found interesting: percentage of already minted coins (current supply divided by maximum supply).

Try it out for yourself by clicking on the image below:
