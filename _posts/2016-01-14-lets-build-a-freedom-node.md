title: Let's build a Freedom Node
---

Recently, I decided to support some of the open-source distributed projects such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/). One way of supporting them would be to send some [money as a donation](https://www.torproject.org/donate), but because I am a hacker with a good Internet connection I decided to build a computer node that will directly contribute to their networks and make them bigger and more robust.

I call it a "Freedom Node".

## Hardware

I evaluated lot of options and ended up buying the following components from my local computer hardware supplier:

| item | model | price |
|------|------|------:|
| Barebone PC by Gigabyte | [GB-BXBT-1900](http://amzn.to/1TO7SyU) | $139.99 |
| 8 GB RAM by Kingston | [KVR16LS11/8](http://amzn.to/1mOhUWs) | $35.38 |
| 240 GB SSD by Crucial | [CT240BX200SSD1](http://amzn.to/1TQMXeG) | $64.99 |

I have decided to go for a solid-state drive option, but you can replace the suggested hard drive
with a cheaper rotating disk (option A) or even bigger more expensive solid-state disk (option B):

| item | model | price |
|------|------|------:|
| A) 750 GB HDD by Western Digital | [WD7500BPKX](http://amzn.to/1RHIOKH) | $58.99 |
| B) 480 GB SSD by Crucial | [CT480BX200SSD1](http://amzn.to/1TQN61w) | $129.99 |

The cheapest option is around $235, while the most expensive is around $305.

And this is how it looks! Nice, isn't it?

It is really small and quiet and it fits anywhere in your appartment or office, so you will completely forget about it.

## Software

Now for the software part. I am going to use CentOS, because I am used to RPM distributions, but the process should be similar if you use Debian or Ubuntu.

* Let's download CentOS from [https://www.centos.org/download/](https://www.centos.org/download/) and copy the ISO to a USB flash drive.

* Follow the installation instructions and install the system.

* Add EPEL (Extra Packages) repository by running:

~~~bash
yum install epel-release
~~~

* Add Ringing Liberty Bitcoin repository by running:

~~~bash
yum install https://linux.ringingliberty.com/bitcoin/el7/x86_64/bitcoin-release-2-1.noarch.rpm
~~~

* Install Tor, Bitcoin and Go language:

~~~bash
yum install tor bitcoin-server golang
~~~

(If you want to use Bitcoin XT instead of Bitcoin Core just use `bitcoinxt-server` package instead of `bitcoin-server` in the line above.)

* Edit the Tor configuration file `/etc/tor/torrc` and uncomment the following lines (the first line opens the relay port, the second one enables the directory service, the third one disables the exit node):

~~~
ORPort 9001
DirPort 9030
ExitPolicy reject *:*
~~~

Also fill in the details on lines with `Nickname` and `ContactInfo`.

If you are more adventurous you might skip uncommenting the `ExitPolicy reject` line, but I recommend [reading something](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node-minimal-harassment) about running an Exit Node first.

* Edit the Bitcoin configuration file `/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` and change RPC password to something random:

~~~ini
rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=something_random_like_8aRuH7Dxa0NBegBWLVNTndF_but_longer
~~~

* Add the following files to your `~/.bashrc` file and relogin:

~~~bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/.go
~~~

* Install IPFS and make a symlink to `/usr/bin`:

~~~bash
go get -u github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs
ln -s /root/.go/bin/ipfs /usr/bin/ipfs
~~~

* Initialize IPFS node:

~~~bash
ipfs init
~~~

* Create IPFS systemd service file `/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipfs.service` and put the following contents in it:

~~~ini
[Unit]
Description=IPFS daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ipfs daemon
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multiuser.target
~~~

* Run and enable start at boot for all three services using the following commands:

~~~bash
systemctl enable bitcoin
systemctl start bitcoin

systemctl enable tor
systemctl start tor

systemctl enable ipfs
systemctl start ipfs
~~~

* Enjoy and big THANK YOU for your important contribution to these networks!
