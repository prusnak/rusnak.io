title: Google Summer of Code Mentors Summit 2008 - Day 0
---

## Day 0 - 2008/10/24

In my previous blogpost I described the project I mentored during this year's Google Summer of Code event. At the end of October I was invited into Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California for Mentors Summit. Here you can find my remarks.

* arrived at the [Wild Palms Hotel](http://www.jdvhotels.com/wild_palms/) at around 3pm and took a short nap
* Google planned a dinner for us at [Amarin Thai](http://www.amarinthaicuisine.com/) restaurant, left the hotel around quarter to six
* used [VTA](http://www.vta.org/) public bus transport to get there; turned out to be pretty adventurous: one had to request the stop and the stops were not announced; fortunately had a map software in my cellphone so I was able to track my position by looking out of the window and advancing cursor in my mobile map :)
* arrived to the restaurant; not so many people yet, soon started to change ...

* met [Leslie Hawthorn](http://www.hawthornlandings.org/) (the official geek herder :)) for the first time
* sat at the table with [Earl Miles](http://www.angrydonuts.com/) and his wife from [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), David Wollner from [BZFlag](http://www.bzflag.org/) and [Joel Sherrill](http://www.rtems.com/~joel/) from [RTEMS](http://www.rtems.com/) project
* talking about our projects; served with various Thai dishes, some of them were very exotic
* after an hour or so we headed to the [Tied House](http://www.tiedhouse.com/)

* some snacks and free beer at the Tied House, heeey! :)
* American beer is not what I'm used to, too thick for me :(
* went to two tall guys: Matt Handley from [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) and Werner Guttmann mentoring [Castor](http://www.castor.org/)
* when talking about Czech Republic, [Ondrej Certik](http://ondrej.certik.cz/) from [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/) appeared too
* heard two people talking about [openSUSE Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service), interested who could it be ...
* mystery solved: [Oleksandr Moskalenko](http://tagancha.org/) from the [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/) team and [Lance Albertson](http://osuosl.org/info/people) from [Oregon State University](http://osuosl.org/) - Scribus is one of the first larger projects that started to build their own packages using Build Service, Lance was mentoring a project which aimed to create packages for various distributions using [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) ebuilds
* noted that the dependencies of the packages are the a big problem, Lance had to admit that I'm right; they actually use database of packages and their dependencies for each distribution, must be huge and hard to maintain!
* there are two [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) mentors here! [Donnie Berkholz](http://dberkholz.wordpress.com/) and Alec Warner
* short talk with [Johannes Schmid](http://blogs.gnome.org/johannes/) from [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) about [Mono](http://mono-project.com/)
* approached by [Stefan Reinauer](http://www.stefan-reinauer.de/) from [coreboot](http://www.coreboot.org/); learned that he used to work for SUSE once, in the Arch team; he decided to start his own business with LinuxBIOS (or coreboot, like it is called nowadays)
* short talk with guys from [OSSIM](http://www.ossim.net/) project (Pablo Rincón Crespo and Juan Manuel Lorenzo)
* headed back to the hotel with Brooks Davis from [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) and his wife

* finally found out who my roommate is! it's David Bruce from [Tux4Kids](http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/) project
* we talked a little bit about his work, promised to show him [openSUSE Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service) the other day
* I fell into bed exhausted, but really looking forward for the actual summit and its sessions

Days 1 and 2 will appear tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I promise to post some photos too :)
