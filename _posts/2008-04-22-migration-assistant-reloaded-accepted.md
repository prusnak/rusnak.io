Hooray!

My proposal for [Migration Assistant project](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2008#Migration_Assistant_Reloaded) was picked by student Peter Libič and later accepted by Google as [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/suse/about.html) project for openSUSE. I'm looking forward to this collaboration and the new ideas that will surely come! :)
