title: Idea Factory - Coin Counter
---

This post is a part of [Idea Factory](/idea-factory/) series. The idea is simple: create a mobile phone application that is able to count coins (and their values) from the photo.

You pour coins from your wallet on the table, make sure they don't overlap by spreading them, take a photo and voila
the phone will tell you exactly how much money in coins you have. User can select what currency is she using
(dollars/cents, euros/cents, etc., to make the recognition easier). Using [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) or some
other computer vision library should make this task pretty easy.

Special points awarded if the application is using realtime augmented reality, but for this particular case it is not necessary.
