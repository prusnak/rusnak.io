title: My Candidacy for the openSUSE Board
---

Â¡Hola openSUSE Folks! I'd like to announce my candidacy for [openSUSE Board Elections 2009](http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2009).

My name is Pavol Rusnak and I'm 25 years old. I was born in [Kosice, Slovakia](http://maps.google.com/?q=kosice,slovakia), but for the last 7 years I've been living in [Prague, Czech Republic](http://maps.google.com/?q=prague), where I graduated from computer science at the Charles University.

You might recognize me from various openSUSE related mailing lists or IRC channels, where I use nick prusnak, or from my blog, which is syndicated on [Planet SUSE](http://planetsuse.org/). Some of you have met me during conferences like [openSUSE Conference](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Conf_2009) in September and I'm looking forward to meet you all at [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/) in February.

I've been at Novell for 3 years now and at the same time I became a part of openSUSE project. I started in the [Czech Packagers Team](http://en.opensuse.org/Czech_Packagers_Team), where I was responsible for lots of networking and XML packages (e.g. wireshark, libxml2), game libraries (e.g. the whole libSDL stack) and Xfce desktop environment. Times has changed since and now I maintain (with a great help of you, community maintainers) countless number of packages all across the Build Service (with Contrib and Games being momentarily my favorite repositories :-)).

In July 2009, I was happy to join the [openSUSE Boosters Team](http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team), a "team which is pushing the openSUSE project forward as a part and for the benefit of the community". During our brainstorming sessions we managed to create a list of nearly [40 projects](http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team/Projects) or ideas worth pursuing.

I applied for the board, because I think it should consist of both technical and non-technical people. Currently there is a lot of discussion, but less of actual implementing things. As a person with great technical overview I can steer the community members around particular topics they choose to work on. I can bootstrap their activity, give them helping hand in the beginnings and try the best to develop their project into a fully independent one. A great example of this is inclusion of LXDE into openSUSE.

There is a huge amount of work ahead of us and I would be glad to drive the effort not only from the openSUSE Boosters Team perspective but also from the openSUSE Board point of view.

Thank you!
