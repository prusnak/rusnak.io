title: openSUSE Junior Jobs
---

Our dear friends at KDE have a really nifty feature in their Bugzilla. They mark easy tasks or "low-hanging fruits" with the "`JJ:`" prefix (meaning Junior Job). We like the idea so much that we decided to adopt it in our Bugzilla too. I created a trimmed URL - [http://tr.im/opensusejj](http://tr.im/opensusejj) - which lists all such issues. If the bugreport is not verbose enough or it is not clear what to do, feel free to ask developer assigned to the bug. I'm sure he or she will give you a helping hand. :-) [Michal](http://michal.hrusecky.net/) started a [wikipage](http://en.opensuse.org/Junior_Jobs) which provides more details.
