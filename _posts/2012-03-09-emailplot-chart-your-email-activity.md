title: Emailplot - chart your email activity
---

Today I stumbled upon this fascinating article called [The Personal Analytics of My Life](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/) by Stephen Wolfram. I immediately started to write my own script which produces the first chart in the article - daily distribution of sent emails.

You can fetch it from my [misc repo](https://github.com/prusnak/misc) on github and play with it (requires ruby and rcairo). Output for my outboxes looks like this (red dots are personal emails, green ones are related to [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org/)):

I might implement other charts mentioned in the Stephen's article in the future, but no promises. :)
