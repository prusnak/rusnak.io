title: openSUSE IRC Word Clouds
---

You might know a web tool call [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/). It's a simple way how to create nice word clouds from texts. It has one disadvantage though. It runs as a web service, so you cannot run it offline. I tried to find the source but the only thing I found was [this FAQ answer](http://www.wordle.net/faq#code), where Jonathan (the author) mentioned working for IBM. After few search queries I found [Word-Cloud Generator](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wordcloud), which seems like the Wordle predecessor from IBM that can be run offline.

After some fiddling with the tool I present you these (word clouds from 3 big openSUSE IRC channels I am on, #opensuse-buildservice, #opensuse-factory, #opensuse-project):

Come on, join our IRC channels and have a lot of fun!
