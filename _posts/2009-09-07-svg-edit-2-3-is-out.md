title: SVG-edit 2.3 is out!
---

During the last weekend we released version 2.3 of our in-browser SVG editor called [SVG-edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit). If I was a [DnB producer](http://www.hospitalrecords.com/artists/) I would call this a "massive" release, because it includes lots of new features. :-) To name some of them:

* Rotate tool
* Polygon/Polyline Editing
* Linear Gradient Picking
* View and Edit Source
* Clone tool
* Align tool
* Firefox extension
* Opera widget

[Jeff Schiller](http://www.codedread.com/) also prepared two screencasts. The older one is an introduction to SVG-edit, where he uses 2.2 version. And the newer one, which presents some of the new features included in 2.3 release.
