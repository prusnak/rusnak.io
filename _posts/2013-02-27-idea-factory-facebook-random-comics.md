title: Idea Factory - Facebook Random Comics
---

This post is a part of [Idea Factory](/idea-factory/) series. Recently my friend sent me a link to this great [random comic generator](http://pandyland.net/random/) at Pandyland. My idea is to create a similar application but instead of the drawn figures it would use your friends photos from Facebook.

One could check which of his/hers friends
should appear in the comic (or leave it to a random chance), select the layout
of the comic strip (e.g. 3x1 frames, 2x2 frames, etc.) and click the generate button. The application
then calls the Facebook API which returns reasonable photos together
with their metadata (such as who is in the picture and at what pixel position, the API already
includes that kind of info in the results). Next step is to add speech bubbles filled in with
either random sentences or leaving the bubbles empty so one can add his/hers own replicas.
Lastly, a nice frames and a title are added, so the result could be shared back
to Facebook or any other webiste as one image.
