title: Prototype Git backend for openSUSE BuildService
---

I'm happy to announce that this year I'll be mentoring GSoC project which will attempt to create an alternative source backend using [git](http://git-scm.com/). Student implementing the idea is Peter Libiƒç.

I have created an openSUSE [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Git_Backend) with the copy of the proposal and some useful links. Some of my colleagues (like [Andreas Gruenbacher](http://www.suse.de/~agruen/) and [Brandon Philips](http://ifup.org/)) are also interested in topic and already provided a valuable feedback. If you'd like to get involved, feel free to contact me, edit the project wiki page or join us on IRC channel [#obs-git@irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/#obs-git).
