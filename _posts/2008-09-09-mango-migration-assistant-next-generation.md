title: Mango - Migration Assistant Next GeneratiOn
---

This years Google Sumer of Code, student Peter Libiƒç tried to implement an idea of Migrating Assistant. MacOSX contains a utility which can import users, application settings and various files from old Macintosh to new one. Idea to port this functionality to Linux is not new. Something similar was created during GSoC two years ago by Ubuntu, but we tried to use different approach (object oriented C++) so the code is better extendable and maintainable.

Application support is not as wide as it probably should be, but because of the clean design, we hope that the number of supported applications will rise in the future. You can try Mango for yourself - packages are ready in BuildService and we are looking forward to feedback from you.
