title: openSUSE accepted for Google Summer of Code 2009
---

Folks at Google announced the [list of accepted organizations](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009) for [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) 2009 tonight. I am very happy that [openSUSE](http://en.opensuse.org/) was included again. Of course, we don't want to disappoint them, so keep your great [ideas coming](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2009#Ideas)! :-)
