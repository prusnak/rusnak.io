The Phosphor 360 ver. B installation is a prototype of a new visual mechanism connecting laser projection, mapping and generative motion graphics with an energy accumulating material. Japanese artist and production engineer Daito Manabe tested a UV laser on a phosphor coated projection surface. P360B also uses a UV laser projector, but it is mounted on a 360° rotating head making it possible to cover selected areas. Real-time generated graphic is projected on objects located nearby. A strong UV beam charges the phosphor-coated surface of the geometric objects that radiate energy in the form of visible structures, compositions and images
