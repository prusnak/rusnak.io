Installation is a combination of old visual mechanism with the latest light technology, using optical discoveries of professor Jules Lissajous, who first described complex harmonic motion by using simple curves and equations.

In this project the harmonic motion is generated by large pendulum which "draws" using a beam of UV laser on a phosphor projection screen placed underneath it. This strong UV beam charges the phosphor surface that subsequently emits the energy in the form of visible structures, compositions and images.
