Trezor is the first hardware wallet providing security for your bitcoins by virtue of its design while retaining convenience of use. No matter whether you're a beginner or a security-paranoid geek.

Trezor is basically a small computer. It is designed to protect your private keys from possible online and offline risks. In order to do this, Trezor keeps the private keys away from the Internet and confirms the transactions in-device. That way you can always check the screen for the right address, amount and transaction fee before sending your bitcoins.
