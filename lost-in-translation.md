A book with plain pages stands on a pedestal. When someone approaches it, the text slowly appears on its pages. When a page is turned, the book reacts by showing different contents respecting the direction of a page flip. After the person walks away, the book again returns to its original empty form.

The work being a collaboration with Richard Janecek was featured in the National Technical Library (NTK) Gallery in Prague. It uses Kinect and a digital projector to achieve the mentioned effect, so similarly to iaMap Sandbox the technology stays well hidden from the spectator. On every approach the book is opened to a random page and there is a possibility to have a library of books so each time the displayed book is picked randomly as well.
